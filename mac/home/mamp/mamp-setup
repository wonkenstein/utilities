Install the MAMP directory into Applications

APACHE
Edit MAMP Apache Setup 
* /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/http.conf
* Enable vhosts in conf file by uncommenting line
  # Virtual hosts                                                                                     
  Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

Set up vhost files so we can create one vhost.conf file per vhost and get
included by apache automatically
* mkdir /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/vhost 
 * This is where the vhost files will live
* In default vhost file add following line to end of it so conf files get 
included by apache automatically
  Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/vhost/*.conf
* touch vhost/localhost.conf and add the following contents
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin mail@example.com
    DocumentRoot "[DocumentRoot]"
    ServerName localhost
    ErrorLog "logs/locahost-error_log"
    CustomLog "logs/localhost-access_log" common
</VirtualHost>  

* Restart MAMP
* Go to http://localhost in browser and check it's viewable
